=== 0.8.5 / 2010-06-15

* Added default value selector

=== 0.8.4 / 2010-06-02

* Add :apply transformation
* Rename _transform to transform_value, make it public

=== 0.8.3 / 2010-05-27

* Attempt to recognize incomplete RSS documents with a simpler regular 
  expression, since the full one causes FeedMe to hang on large documents.
* Fix NPE in html-cleaner.
* Add concept of value selectors: when calling the singular accessor for a tag
that has multiple instance, a value selector chooses which to return. Provide a
default value selector for link tags.

=== 0.8.2 / 2010-01-14

* Remove VERSION variable from feedme.rb
* Don't double-escape CDATA-escaped content

=== 0.8.1 / 2010-01-02

* Add new transformation :esc
* Expose parsed tags as attribute :fm_parsed

=== 0.8 / 2009-12-14

* Add new virtual method _values: returns all values for a given tag.
* Transformations with arguments are now specified as an array rather than
  part of the symbol
* Add transform method
* Add regexp transform
* Add nokogiri support (hpricot is still the default)
* Copy/paste and fix feed-normalizer clean_html method, drop feed-normalizer dependency

=== 0.7.1 / 2009-09-24

* Fix nil_or_empty? to strip whitespace from strings

=== 0.7 / 2009-09-24

* Design decision: all element and attribute names will be stored as lower-case. They may still
  be accessed using upper case, since keys will be normalized by all accessors.
* Design decision: RDF will be dealt with at parse time: elements with rdf:resource attributes will be
  replaced by the actual, referenced elements. Ordering of the referring elements will be preserved.
* Removed the concept of ghost tags. 

=== 0.6.5 / 2009-09-24

* Fix :truncHtml completely by requiring active_support.

=== 0.6.4 / 2009-09-23

* Roll version to make github happy.

=== 0.6.3 / 2009-09-23

* Fix truncHtml: use code by Henrik Nyh, which in turn uses Hypricot

=== 0.6.2 / 2009-09-23

* Fix content-parsing regular expression to correctly handle closed elements
* Reverse earlier design decision: keep namespaces for attributes.

=== 0.6.1 / 2009-09-23

* Improve handling of rdf:items. From now on, .items will forward to .item_array. The rdf items can still be accessed by [:items_array] or .items_array.

=== 0.6 / 2009-09-23

* Fix handling of the items element (mostly affects RSS 1.0 documents)
* Make attribute naming consistent
* Design decision: attributes can only ever have a single value, so they will always be stored as scalars
  rather than arrays. This will also nicely resolve any possible collisions between attribute and tag names.

=== 0.5.4 / 2009-09-22

* Minor improvements to to_indented_s
* Fix tag names: change all tags with namespaces to the cleaned version (unquote, ':' replaced with '_')
* Design decision: all attribute names will have their namespaces stripped; namespaces are generally
  treated as optional (even if they aren't technically so) and it's annoying to have to check both forms;
  this decision may be reversed if there are found to be conflicts

=== 0.5.3 / 2009-09-22

* Roll version to test GitHub wierdness.

=== 0.5.2 / 2009-09-22

* Improve to_s method for prettier array display.

=== 0.5.1 / 2009-09-21

* Update example code
* Bug fix: call_virtual_method has invalid return if neither a key nor any of its aliases has a value
* Subsequent releases will follow standard versioning model of "major.minor.bugfix"

=== 0.5 / 2009-09-21

* Special handling for atom id tag
* to_indented_str method, which creates a pretty output for a FeedData
* Improved to_s method that delegates to to_indented_str

=== 0.4 / 2009-09-20

* Expose call_virtual_method as public
* Change 'name' argument of call_virtual_method to 'sym'
* Add default value for call_virtual_method 'args' argument
* Add :'media:content' and :'content:encoded' as ext tags
* fix use of FeedNormalizer in :cleanHtml transformation

=== 0.3 / 2009-09-18

* Update example code
* Bug fix: call_virtual_method always throws exception
* Bug fix: responds_to? -> respond_to? and rels -> :rels

=== 0.2 / 2009-09-12

* Change bang mods to more flexible transformations framework. 
* Add additional transformation functions. 
* Add methods for RSS/Atom emulation that automatically add appropriate aliases. 
* Add empty_string_for_nil and error_on_missing_key options. 
* Add support for parsing only certain rels in the strict parser. 

=== 0.1 / 2009-09-03

* Everything is new. First release.
