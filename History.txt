=== 0.6.2 / 2009-09-23

* Fix content-parsing regular expression to correctly handle closed elements
* Reverse earlier design decision: keep namespaces for attributes.

=== 0.6.1 / 2009-09-23

* Improve handling of rdf:items. From now on, .items will forward to .item_array. The rdf items can still be accessed by [:items_array] or .items_array.

=== 0.6 / 2009-09-23

* Fix handling of the items element (mostly affects RSS 1.0 documents)
* Make attribute naming consistent
* Design decision: attributes can only ever have a single value, so they will always be stored as scalars
  rather than arrays. This will also nicely resolve any possible collisions between attribute and tag names.

=== 0.5.4 / 2009-09-22

* Minor improvements to to_indented_s
* Fix tag names: change all tags with namespaces to the cleaned version (unquote, ':' replaced with '_')
* Design decision: all attribute names will have their namespaces stripped; namespaces are generally
  treated as optional (even if they aren't technically so) and it's annoying to have to check both forms;
  this decision may be reversed if there are found to be conflicts

=== 0.5.3 / 2009-09-22

* Roll version to test GitHub wierdness.

=== 0.5.2 / 2009-09-22

* Improve to_s method for prettier array display.

=== 0.5.1 / 2009-09-21

* Update example code
* Bug fix: call_virtual_method has invalid return if neither a key nor any of its aliases has a value
* Subsequent releases will follow standard versioning model of "major.minor.bugfix"

=== 0.5 / 2009-09-21

* Special handling for atom id tag
* to_indented_str method, which creates a pretty output for a FeedData
* Improved to_s method that delegates to to_indented_str

* Change 'name' argument of call_virtual_method to 'sym'
